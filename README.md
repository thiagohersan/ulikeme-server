# uLikeMe (on facebook)
An app for opening yourself up and allowing others to love you.

This is the server part. It should run somewhere on the internet.  
It uses node.js and WebSockets to make the right connections.

The only dependency is the node.js [ws implementation](http://einaros.github.io/ws/).

Full app is [here](https://github.com/thiagohersan/uLikeMe)
